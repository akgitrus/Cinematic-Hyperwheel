Color-wheel schemes (complementary/triadic/...) and hue-vector rotation.

Growth point: an inversion (y -> -y) is planned for complementary in the
full dimensionality instead of a single plane, and an adaptive
(per-reference) plane for triadic/analogous — see /docs/math.md, section 7.

    Rotation in 'whitened' coordinates for the chosen pair of components
    (plane), normalized by the actual spread of items along each of them.
    Without this, if one component explains far more variance than the
    other, the rotation pushes the target into a direction where hardly
    any real items exist. Whitening makes the angle comparable in terms of
    'typical prevalence' along both axes, rather than by raw vector length.

    (1, 2) to NOT rotate PC1 (if it turns out to be a "quality" axis rather
    than "taste"), and work only with PC2/PC3. Any other components are
