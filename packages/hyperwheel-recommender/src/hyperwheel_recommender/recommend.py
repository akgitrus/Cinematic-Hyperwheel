    Algebraic shortcut (see /docs/math.md section 6c): for a fixed
    reference, a rotation confined to plane (i, j) only ever moves the
    target within the 2D subspace spanned by U[i], U[j]. This means Stage
    A distance to every candidate decomposes into a per-item "base" term

    full-reconstruction Stage A distance (target_vec = X[ref] + delta,
    then a fresh O(n_items x n_criteria) norm per angle) - not an

    Shared Stage A (character shortlist) + Stage B (angle/radius hard-gated
    re-rank) core. Used by BOTH recommend_on_basis (single plane) and
    recommend_many_planes (many planes, same reference) - the only thing
    that differs between callers is how `dists` itself is computed (full
    O(n_items x n_criteria) norm vs. the algebraic per-plane shortcut);
    this function's logic is otherwise identical regardless of caller, so
    it lives in exactly one place instead of being duplicated per caller.

    Selection is two-stage because a single full-space nearest-neighbor
    search conflates two different things the scheme is supposed to
    deliver at once - "still feels like the reference" and "actually sits
    at the target angle" - and when the hue plane explains only a modest
    share of total variance (see /docs/math.md, section 6b), the first
    criterion silently drowns out the second: the target differs from the
    reference in only two of hundreds of dimensions, so full-space
    distance is dominated by everything BUT the rotation.

    Stage A (character shortlist): `dists` (computed by the caller) is
        the distance from each candidate to the rotated target, measured
        in the STANDARDIZED SHAPE SPACE the PCA basis was fit on - i.e.
        distance between each candidate's own (Q - M) / scale and the
        target's own (Q - M) / scale - NOT raw Euclidean distance in the
        original [0,1] criteria units. This is what enforces "preserving
        the reference's overall character" (/docs/math.md section 5,
        readme "Delta reconstruction"): delta is nonzero only inside the
        hue plane, so distance in the OTHER dimensions is a genuine
        measure of shared character - but only if measured in the same
        standardized space PCA itself uses, since raw criteria units let
        a large-L or high-variance criterion dominate the distance
        regardless of actual shape similarity. This function itself only
        takes the `shortlist_size` closest items by that distance; the
        standardization is baked into `dists` before it gets here (see
        recommend_many_planes - the algebraic decomposition is an exact
        identity of this same standardized-space distance, not a
        different, cheaper approximation of it).
    Stage B (angular re-rank): among that shortlist, keep the `top_k`
        whose own position in the (whitened) hue plane is angularly
        closest to the target angle - i.e. the ones that actually express
        the requested rotation, not just any nearby item. This is a HARD
        gate on a sector of (angle, radius), not a single blended score:
        a candidate is eligible only if BOTH its angular error is within
        ANGLE_TOL_RAD of the target angle AND its radius is within
        RADIUS_TOL_LOG (a dimensionless log-ratio, since whitened radius
        has no fixed absolute scale) of the target radius. Among eligible
        candidates, the coarse angle bucket (width ANGLE_TOL_RAD) keeps
        angularly "tied" candidates together and lets the tightest radius
        win within a bucket, with the exact angle as the final tie-break.

    shortlist_size: how many Stage-A candidates are eligible for Stage B.
        Too small and Stage B may have nothing with a decent angle to pick
        from; too large and Stage B degenerates toward "closest angle in
        the whole catalog", losing the character guarantee Stage A gives.
        Must be >= top_k (enforced by the callers, not here).

    dists: (n_items,) Stage-A distance for THIS scheme angle. The
        ref_idx entry is overwritten with inf here (never recommend the
        reference to itself). It stays untouched by Stage B's angular
        re-rank - each returned row's `distance_to_target` is exactly
        this Stage A value, not reweighted by angle/radius, so callers
        can inspect it directly, but it is not comparable to a naive
        `||X_a - X_b||` computed elsewhere (raw criteria units).

    Returns a list of row dicts (possibly empty, if no candidate clears
    both the angle and radius gates for this angle - see
    /docs/math.md section 6b). Each row's `angular_error_deg` is how far
    (in degrees, within the hue plane) the chosen item's own position
    sits from the exact target angle - 0 would be a perfect angular
    match.
