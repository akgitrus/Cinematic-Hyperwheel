"""
Per-reference adaptive hue-plane selection.

With a diffuse variance spectrum (no single dominant pair of components -
e.g. PC1=14.8%, PC2=6.3%, PC3=5.3%, then a long thin tail), fixing one
global (i, j) pair for every reference item has a real cost: for a given
item, its distinguishing character might live almost entirely in, say,
PC7 and PC12, while PC2/PC3 are close to the category-typical value for
that particular item. Rotating a globally-fixed PC2/PC3 plane would then
barely change the item at all, or worse, rotate axes that say nothing
about what actually makes this item distinctive.

select_hue_plane() instead looks at THIS reference's own z-score along
each candidate component (score / pc_std - how many typical standard
deviations this item sits from the category norm on that axis, NOT the
raw score) and picks the two axes where the item itself is most
expressive. Using the raw score instead of the z-score would bias the
choice toward components with naturally larger population variance
(PC2/PC3 again) regardless of whether THIS item stands out there - the
z-score corrects for that.
