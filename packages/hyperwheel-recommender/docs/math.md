# Hyperwheel: math and design rationale

## 1. Problem

Given a category of items, each described by values across N criteria
(0..1), with no inherent "better/worse" direction on the criteria
themselves (like the R,G,B channels — no channel is "better" than
another). Given a reference item, we want to suggest real items "in the
spirit of" classic color-wheel schemes (complementary, triadic, analogous,
etc.), preserving the reference's overall character while meaningfully
shifting its "hue".

## 2. Analogy with HSL

| HSL (color, 3 channels) | This approach (N criteria) |
|---|---|
| L = mean of R,G,B for one pixel | L = mean of criteria for one item |
| Hue = angle in a fixed 120°-apart basis (R,G,B) | Hue = direction in a data-driven plane (PCA) |
| S = saturation | S = degree to which the "shape" is pronounced (norm of deviation from the typical profile) |

Key difference from classic HSL: in HSL the hue basis is fixed by the
physiology of human vision (R,G,B are equally spaced on the wheel). For
arbitrary criteria, no such physical basis exists — it must be **extracted
from the data**, not postulated by column order.

## 3. Basis-building pipeline

For an item `c` (a vector of length N):

1. **L (lightness)** — the item's own mean across criteria:
   `L = mean(c)`

2. **Q (shape)** — deviation from its own mean:
   `Q = c - L`
   (the components of Q always sum to 0 — this is the hyperplane
   perpendicular to (1,...,1), the direct analog of the chromatic plane
   in HSL)

3. **M (category-typical profile)** — the mean of Q **across all items**
   in the category (critical!):
   `M = mean(Q over items)`
   Without this step, PCA picks up the shape structure common to all
   items as the "main difference", rather than the real variation between
   items.

4. **Standardization** — criteria are divided by their std (after
   subtracting M), so that criteria with a larger random spread don't
   dominate PCA purely due to scale rather than real correlation with
   other criteria.

5. **PCA / SVD** on the normalized shape vectors of all items → an
   orthonormal basis U (the real principal axes of variation in the
   category), together with the fraction of variance explained per
   component.

## 4. Choosing the hue plane

Not all components are equally suitable for rotation. In practice, some
components turn out to be a general-"quality" axis (a halo effect: good
items get praised on many criteria at once, bad items get criticized on
many criteria at once), rather than a taste/character axis. Rotating
along such an axis doesn't give a "different in spirit" item — it gives
an objectively better/worse one, which defeats the purpose.

**Solution**: the components used for rotation are chosen explicitly
(`--hue-components`), after manually inspecting them via `diagnose`
(criteria weights + the list of items at each pole — what the component
physically represents). Non-rotated components aren't ignored entirely —
they're kept close to the reference via the delta mechanism (section 5).

## 5. Rotation and reconstruction

For a chosen pair of components (i, j):

1. Whitening — normalize each axis by its actual std across items
   (otherwise, when the explained-variance share differs strongly between
   components, a 90-120° rotation pushes the target into a region where
   hardly any real items exist).
2. Rotate by the scheme's angle (180° complementary, ±120° triadic, ±30°
   analogous, etc.) in whitened coordinates.
3. **Delta, not rebuild**: only the change introduced by the rotation
   within the chosen plane is added to the reference vector; everything
   else (including non-rotated components) stays as in the reference.
4. The target vector almost never matches a real item exactly — the
   final step is a nearest-neighbor search for the closest real item to
   that target.

## 6. Known limitations / open questions

- Rotation currently works strictly within one 2D plane. For >2
  significant axes, two extensions were identified:
  - **Adaptive per-reference plane selection (implemented, section 6a
    below)**: instead of one globally-fixed pair, pick the two components
    on which each specific reference item is most expressive.
  - **Complementary via full-dimensional inversion (not yet implemented)**:
    a 180° rotation in any 2D plane containing the reference vector itself
    is equivalent to **inverting** that vector (y → −y) — well-defined in
    **any** dimensionality, not just 2D. Complementary could use the full
    "taste" vector (all components except excluded quality axes), using
    100% of the real taste variation instead of just one plane.
- Choosing which components represent "quality" (to exclude from
  rotation) is currently manual, based on visually reviewing `diagnose`.
  Automatically detecting such axes (e.g. by correlating a component with
  an independent rating, if one exists in the data) could remove this
  manual step.
- The PCA basis is fit on the whole category at once; if criteria become
  genuinely unequal in the future (not just in scale, but in physical
  meaning/weight), a separate weighting scheme will be needed — see the
  discussion at the start of work on this approach.

### 6a. Adaptive per-reference hue-plane selection

On real data the variance spectrum can be strongly diffuse - no dominant
pair beyond a "quality" axis (PC1), just a long thin tail (e.g. PC2=6.3%,
PC3=5.3%, ..., PC100=0.1%, cumulative ~73% only after 255 components).
Fixing one global (i, j) pair for every reference item has a real cost in
this regime: a given item's distinguishing character might live almost
entirely in, say, PC8 and PC12, while a globally-fixed PC2/PC3 stays
close to the category-typical value for that specific item - rotating it
would barely change anything, or would rotate axes that say nothing about
what actually makes this item distinctive.

`hue_components="auto"` (the CLI default) instead computes, for the given
reference, its **z-score** along every candidate component:

```
z_k = score_k / pc_std_k
```

i.e. how many typical standard deviations this item sits from the
category norm on axis k - and picks the two axes with the largest |z_k|.
Using the raw score instead of the z-score would systematically favor
components with a larger population variance (PC2/PC3 again) regardless
of whether this particular item stands out there; the z-score corrects
for that (verified empirically: raw-score and z-score ranking disagree on
which components rank highest for the same reference item).

Two safeguards:
- `exclude_components` (default: PC1 only) - components that must never
  be selected, e.g. a known "quality" axis.
- `candidate_components` - caps how far into the long tail the selection
  is allowed to look. Without a cap, a component explaining almost no
  variance overall (e.g. PC200 at 0.1%) could still get picked just
  because one item happens to spike there by chance, essentially fitting
  to noise rather than a real taste dimension.

Verified on synthetic data reproducing the diffuse spectrum: different
reference items reliably resolve to different, non-overlapping component
pairs (e.g. PC8/PC12, PC3/PC5, PC6/PC17, PC9/PC18 across four different
references in one test run).

### 6b. Two-stage selection: character shortlist + angular re-rank

A single full-space nearest-neighbor search on `target_vec` conflates two
different goals: "still feels like the reference" and "actually sits at
the target angle". When the hue plane explains only a modest share of
total variance (e.g. PC2+PC3 at ~11.6% combined, see section 6), the first
goal dominates the full-space distance almost by construction -
`target_vec` differs from the reference in only two of hundreds of
dimensions, so the remaining dimensions decide the ranking, and the
resulting top-k tends to land near-center with an arbitrary angle instead
of near the intended 180°/120°/etc.

`recommend_on_basis` resolves this in two stages instead of one:

- **Stage A** - the `shortlist_size` closest real items to `target_vec`,
  measured in the STANDARDIZED SHAPE SPACE the PCA basis itself was fit
  on (`(Q - M) / scale`, section 3), not raw Euclidean distance in the
  original `[0,1]` criteria units. This is what enforces character
  preservation (section 5) - delta is nonzero only inside the hue plane,
  so distance elsewhere is a genuine measure of shared character, but
  only once L (overall level) and per-criterion scale are normalized out
  the same way they are before PCA; a raw-units distance would instead
  let a shift in overall level, or a single high-variance criterion,
  dominate the ranking regardless of actual shape similarity.
- **Stage B** - among that shortlist, rank by angular distance (in the
  whitened hue plane) to the exact target angle, and keep the closest
  `top_k`. This is what enforces the rotation actually being expressed,
  not just "some nearby item".
   Stage B now applies a HARD radius gate. `RADIUS_TOL_LOG` is a dimensionless,
   symmetric ratio `|log(cand_r / target_r)|` (radius has no fixed absolute scale - it
   varies per reference and per plane - so only relative deviation is meaningful). A
   Stage-A shortlist candidate is eligible for Stage B only if its radius sits within
   this window (e.g. `RADIUS_TOL_LOG = log(1.5)` ~ +/-50%; a tighter value like
   `log(1.1)` ~ +/-10% is stricter, a tunable product gate).

   Angle is now HARD-gated too: a candidate is eligible only if its angular error
   is within `ANGLE_TOL_RAD` of the target as well as its radius being within the
   radius window (a genuine "sector" = angle + radius). Among candidates passing
   both gates, the coarse angle bucket (width `ANGLE_TOL_RAD`) keeps angularly
   "tied" candidates together and lets the tightest radius win within a bucket, with
   the exact angle as the final tie-break. Because both gross outliers are already
   excluded, these buckets only order good sector-matching candidates.

   The magnitude is a tuning choice: the median relative radius deviation across
   Stage-A shortlists is ~log(2); tighter values (e.g. `log(1.5)` or `log(1.1)`)
   keep well-typed references populated and make extreme-saturation references
   (where few/no items exist at the target radius) visibly short or empty.
   Do not set `RADIUS_TOL_LOG = log(1.0)` (=0): with a hard gate that means
   "radius must be exactly equal to target", i.e. nothing ever qualifies.

`distance_to_target` in the output is Stage A's own metric - standardized
shape-space distance, not reweighted by Stage B, and not a raw full-space
Euclidean distance in criteria units. A new `angular_error_deg` column reports Stage B's own
metric per returned item, so callers can see how good the angular match
actually was instead of inferring it indirectly from position on a chart.

`shortlist_size` trades off between the two goals: too small and Stage B
may have nothing with a good angle to choose from (degenerates back to
Stage-A-only behavior); too large and Stage B approaches "closest angle
in the whole catalog" regardless of character, undermining Stage A's
guarantee. No principled default exists yet - start at 50 and inspect
`angular_error_deg` vs. `distance_to_target` across a few reference items
to tune it for a given catalog and n_criteria.
