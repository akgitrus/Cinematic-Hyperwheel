"""
Hyperwheel Recommender — item recommender based on generalized color-wheel schemes.

Idea: each item is described by values across many criteria (with no
inherent "better/worse" direction — like the R,G,B channels of a color).
For an item, we compute:
  L (lightness) - its own average intensity across criteria;
  hue vector     - the direction of its "taste profile" in a low-dimensional
                    plane that PCA discovers from the whole item catalog
                    (rather than from an arbitrary criteria ordering);
  S (saturation) - how pronounced that profile is (norm of the deviation
                    from the category's typical profile).

Full mathematical rationale: /docs/math.md

Library usage:
    from hyperwheel_recommender import load_matrix, build_taste_basis, recommend, diagnose

CLI usage:
    python -m hyperwheel_recommender build data.csv --out artifact.npz
    python -m hyperwheel_recommender diagnose artifact.npz
    python -m hyperwheel_recommender recommend artifact.npz --item "..." --scheme complementary
