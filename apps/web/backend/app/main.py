    """
    Reorders circles_out (already built, one entry per axis pair, each
    carrying its own `angles`) by a normalized weighted combination of two
    signals, each rescaled to [0, 1] so they're actually comparable:

    z_score (per circle): 1.0 for the circle /wheel ranked highest by
        aggregate z-score, 0.0 for the one it ranked lowest, linear in
        between. circles_out arrives already sorted by /wheel's
        z-score-descending order (see wheel.py, circles_for), so the
        incoming index directly gives this rank - no need to recompute it
        from a raw z-score field.
    count_score (per circle): total recommendations actually found across
        all scheme angles (sum of len(angle["items"])) for that circle,
        divided by the highest such count among the circles in THIS
        response. 1.0 = most recommendations found among these circles,
        0.0 = none. Circles starved by Stage B's angle/radius gates
        (recommend.py) score low here even when their z-score is high,
        and vice versa.

    combined = z_weight * z_score + (1 - z_weight) * count_score

    z_weight=0.3 was chosen by testing directly against the target
    behavior ("a circle with meaningfully more recommendations should
    overtake the current #1 by z-score") rather than assumed: with
    z_weight >= 0.35 a circle at z-rank 0 with only half the top
    recommendation count of another circle still won, which is the
    opposite of the intended behavior; 0.3 is the largest weight (in
    steps of 0.05) where it does not. See
    packages/hyperwheel-recommender tests / the accompanying analysis for
    the exact scenario this was checked against. An earlier version of
    this function used Reciprocal Rank Fusion (rank-based, not value-based)
    - it was discarded because at realistic circle counts (2-36, see
    apps/web/README.md "C(n,2) circles") RRF's harmonic rank decay barely
    separates adjacent ranks, so the z-rank-0 circle kept winning
    regardless of how few recommendations it had; this was only caught by
    actually re-running the scenario from the spec, not by inspection.

    Circles with zero recommendations are always placed after every
    circle with at least one, as a hard partition on top of the combined
    score - an empty circle is useless to show as primary or as a
    secondary overlay target no matter how "expressive" the reference
    item is on its axes, and a soft score alone doesn't guarantee that
    (a very high z-score, 0-item circle could otherwise still outscore a
    low-z, 1-item circle).

    The first element of the returned list becomes the new `primary` -
    primary is not a separately computed property; it is BY DEFINITION
    whichever circle ends up ranked first after this reorder. Every
    circle's `primary` field is rewritten accordingly.

    Each circle gets its own recommend_on_basis() call using its own
    plane - Stage A (character shortlist) and Stage B (angle+radius
    re-rank) are both run fresh for each circle's own axes, rather than
    projecting one main-circle result onto the other planes. Because PCA
    components are orthogonal, a good rotation on PC2/PC3 says nothing
    about position on PC5/PC6 - projecting a single result was giving
    secondary circles scattered, unoptimized points. This means each
    circle's top-k items are generally a DIFFERENT set of movies, not the
    same 5 movies viewed from different axes.

    Each returned item also carries imdb_id/tmdb_id (same source as
    /api/movie/{item_id} - see MovieRecord in search.py), so the frontend
    can link straight to IMDb/TMDB instead of a title search wherever the
    dataset has a match.

    Final ordering (and therefore which circle is `primary`) is NOT the
    same as /wheel's plain z-score order: after every circle's own
    recommendations are computed, _combined_order() blends that z-score
    order with how many recommendations each circle actually turned up
    for this scheme (see its docstring) - a circle with a high z-score
    but a nearly-empty result set (common with narrow ANGLE_TOL_RAD /
    RADIUS_TOL_LOG gates, see recommend.py) is demoted below a circle
    that is less "expressive" structurally but produced a full, usable
